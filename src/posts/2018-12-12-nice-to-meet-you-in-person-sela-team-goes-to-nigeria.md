The tagline for November was "Nice to meet you in person". Many members of the Sela team which has been distributed for a long time got a chance to meet and have very productive work sessions in person. Late night convos, team lunches and product launch were on the menu ! We also welcomed David Abimbola and Ibrahim Ilyasu to the growing engineering team 

We are cranking out and getting ready for 2019.
