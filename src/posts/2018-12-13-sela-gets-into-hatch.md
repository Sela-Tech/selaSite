Sela was accepted into a Swiss impact accelerator’s inaugural fellowship program in September. The accelerator, Hatch Colab, empowers entrepreneurs to build impact ventures that solve humanity’s grand challenges and drive sustainable change.



Sela joins a class of 9 social impact organizations from around the world. The program will aid Sela in building out the Sela Platform and collaborating with other organizations focused on sustainable development projects.
