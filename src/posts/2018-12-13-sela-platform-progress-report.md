The tech team made significant progress in building out the Sela Platform. Data visualizations for the platform’s web MVP version were completed. The visualizations include: project maps, analytics dashboards, and aggregations of upload/contribution history. The team focused on the specific needs of Sela’s different user groups for the visualizations.

For example, the platform will display "ID cards" of Sela Citizens, making it easy to see information of their reputation track record on previous projects. The team also improved the data submission user experience to make it more efficient and secure.
