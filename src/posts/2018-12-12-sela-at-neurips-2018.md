Sela Labs was an active participant at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems conference (NeurIPS) which took place in Montréal, Canada through its CTO. 

NeurIPS is the biggest academic gathering of AI researchers in the world and covers an extensive range of activities.

Highlight contributions from Sela include a speech at an AI & Climate change event organized by the Montréal Institute of Learning Algorithms on how AI researchers can team up with ecologists and the private sector to mitigate effects of climate change and build resilient societies.

This contribution was also complemented by Hassan's remarks at the dinner of the second Black in AI workshop on the need to sustain efforts to increase the presence of black people in the field of Artificial Intelligence !

Many fruitful connections were made with actors interested in promoting AI for Good .
